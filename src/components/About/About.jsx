        <p>
          Iâ€™m a full-stack web developer with strong analytical skills and a
          passion for problem-solving. My backgrounds in Electronics Engineering
          have given me an extreme eye for detail, a deep understanding of the
          value of excellent teamwork, and an appreciation of writing clear and
          organized procedures and code. I am ready to bring my skills to a team
          focused on collaboration and the creation of dynamic full-stack
          applications.
